# Anime Recommendor System

# How to Run?
(1) Create three folders in the code directory named 'csv', 'matrices' and 'optimization'

(2) Download the anime dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/CooperUnion/anime-recommendations-database

(3) Add the 'anime.csv' and 'rating.csv' files to the 'csv' folder

(4) Run the 'RecommenderSystem.py' file and it will walk you through the process of running the program with
an interactive dialogue.

# Note:
This program was built to run with Python 2.7 in a Windows environment. In additions, we used the numpy, scipy and sklearn libraries.
